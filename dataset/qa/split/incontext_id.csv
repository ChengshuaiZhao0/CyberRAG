Use JSON format.","['encryption', 'network data']",['has_a'],"[['tool', 'has_a', 'function']]",How does symmetric encryption work?,"Symmetric encryption uses a single shared secret key to encrypt and decrypt data. The same key is used for both encryption and decryption, making it efficient for bulk data encryption. Examples of symmetric encryption algorithms are AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and DES (Data Encryption Standard)."

Use JSON format.","['encryption', 'network data']",['has_a'],"[['tool', 'has_a', 'function']]",What is asymmetric encryption?,"Asymmetric encryption, also known as public-key encryption, involves the use of a key pair: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The public key can be freely shared, while the private key is kept secret. RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) are popular asymmetric encryption algorithms."
