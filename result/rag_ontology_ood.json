For example, an app can use the `document.cookie` property to check if a cookie is set, and if not, it can assume that cookies are disabled. However, it's important to note that this method is not foolproof and can be bypassed by users who know how to disable cookies. Therefore, it's recommended to use a combination of methods to detect cookie disablement, such as checking the browser's settings and parsing the browser's settings file."
