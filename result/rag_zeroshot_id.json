        "Prediction": "ANSWER:\nThe relationship between TCP and IP is that TCP is a transport layer protocol that works in conjunction with the Internet Protocol (IP) to ensure reliable delivery of data over a network. In other words, TCP is built on top of IP and uses IP to deliver packets of data between devices on a network. TCP ensures that data is delivered in the correct order and retransmits any packets that are lost or corrupted during transmission. IP, on the other hand, is responsible for routing packets between devices on the network. Together, TCP and IP provide a reliable and efficient way to transmit data over the internet."

In a SYN attack, the attacker sends a large number of SYN packets to the server, but does not complete the connection by sending the ACK packet.

These measures can help prevent or mitigate the impact of brute force attacks by making it more difficult for attackers to guess or crack passwords. Limiting login attempts can prevent an attacker from making multiple attempts to guess a password, while account lockout policies can lock out an attacker after a certain number of failed login attempts. Multi-factor authentication adds an additional layer of security by requiring the user to provide additional information, such as a code sent to their phone or a biometric scan, in addition to their password.
